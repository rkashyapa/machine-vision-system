# Machine Vision System Architecture

## Overview
This document outlines the architecture of the machine vision system, which consists of the following components:

- **Frontend**: React/Next.js web application
- **Middleware**: Flask API
- **Backend**: Core vision processing modules
  - Device: Camera and hardware interfaces
  - Inference: ML model execution
  - Post-processing: Result analysis and formatting
- **Database**: SQLite for data persistence
- **Docker**: Containerization for deployment

## Component Interactions
1. The frontend communicates with the middleware via REST API calls
2. The middleware coordinates requests to the backend
3. The backend processes images and returns results
4. Results are stored in the database for future reference

## Deployment
The system is containerized using Docker and can be deployed using docker-compose.
