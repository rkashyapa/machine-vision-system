Comprehensive Modular Development & Deployment Strategy
1. Overview
This document outlines a structured approach for developing and deploying a modular, scalable machine vision system. The development will be performed on Windows (primarily by interns), while the final deployment target is Linux. The strategy ensures consistency across environments and minimizes friction during development and deployment. The goal is to develop a lightweight, end-to-end Minimum Viable Product (MVP) that establishes a baseline system with modular components before refining individual elements.
2. System Architecture & Modularization
âœ… Key Development Goals:
Create a lightweight, end-to-end system that serves as a reference implementation.
Enable interns to develop components independently while maintaining compatibility.
Ensure modularity so components (Frontend, Middleware, Backend) are loosely coupled and easily maintainable.
Facilitate smooth deployment from Windows to Linux.

3. High-Level Plan for MVP (Aligning with Architecture)
âœ… Objective:
Develop an end-to-end lightweight MVP that establishes a baseline system with modular components and simulates a real data pipeline. The goal is to test integration, system orchestration, and API interactions before adding actual processing.
ðŸ”¹ Implementation Phases:
A. Backend (Device & Inference Simulation)
Simulate a device that triggers data capture.
Simulate an inference module that processes images from a queue.
Implementation:
Device Simulation (Trigger Event API)
Inference Stub (Mock AI Processing API)
B. Middleware (System Orchestrator)
Manages event-driven workflow.
Queues images and sends them to inference.
Stores results and exposes APIs.
C. Frontend (React Application)
Display real-time structured results from middleware API.
User interface for triggering pipeline.
D. Containerization & Deployment Strategy
Docker-based development for uniform environments.
Docker Compose to manage services.
4. Middleware as an Orchestrator
âœ… Middleware Responsibilities:
System Initialization & Monitoring: Fires up backend services & ensures they listen for events.
Handling Multiple Cameras & Devices (PLCs):
Middleware will manage multiple cameras and devices via unique device IDs.
Each camera and PLC will be assigned a dummy simulation module for testing.
Incoming events will be tagged with device metadata to allow parallel handling.
Event-Driven Data Flow:
Listens for a trigger â†’ Captures an image â†’ Adds to queue.
Passes images to inference engine.
Post-processes results and stores them in the database.
Sends results to the frontend.
Can trigger external PLC actions.
Manages API Exposure: REST & WebSocket APIs for external clients.
ðŸ”¹ Technology Stack:
Framework: Flask (REST API, WebSockets)
Task Queue: Redis + Celery for managing image inference pipeline
Logging & Monitoring: Prometheus, Grafana
5. Handling Camera SDKs & Windows/Linux Compatibility
âœ… Challenges & Fixes:
Some Camera SDKs Don't Work on Windows
Use a mock camera driver for interns working on Windows.
Linux Requires Execute Permissions
Ensure scripts have correct permissions after cloning:
 
chmod +x *.sh

6. Database Considerations
âœ… Key Database Configurations:
Using SQLite for simplicity in both development and production.
All image metadata stored in DB, but actual images stored in a filestore.
Ensure transactional consistency when writing inference results.
7. CI/CD Strategy
âœ… Automated Testing in Both Environments
GitHub Actions to run tests in a Linux container, even if interns develop on Windows.
Example CI pipeline:
 jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Run Pytest
        run: docker-compose run backend pytest

8. Intern Onboarding Guide
âœ… Quickstart for Interns
Clone the repository:
 git clone https://github.com/yourrepo.git
Install Docker & start services:
 docker-compose up --build
Run a sample inference pipeline:
 curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/infer -d '{"image_path": "sample.jpg"}'
9. Best Practices for Future-Proofing
âœ… Key Takeaways:
Develop in Docker, deploy on Linux.
Use WSL2 for Windows development.
Test WebSocket & Flask behavior in both OS environments.
 wscat -c ws://localhost:5000
10. Tech Stack Overview

Automation: GitHub Actions for testing
Monitoring: Prometheus + Grafana

11. Performance Monitoring & Future Optimizations
âœ… Latency Monitoring Strategy:
Phase 1 - REST API Baseline:
- Monitor and log request-response times between services
- Track key metrics:
  * Middleware to Backend latency
  * Image capture to processing completion time
  * End-to-end system latency
- Use Prometheus + Grafana for visualization
- Set baseline performance expectations

Phase 2 - gRPC Migration (If Required):
- Implement if REST latency exceeds 50ms consistently
- Migration Steps:
  1. Define Protocol Buffers for service interfaces
  2. Generate gRPC stubs for Python services
  3. Implement parallel gRPC endpoints alongside REST
  4. A/B test performance improvements
  5. Full migration if benefits are significant

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):
- Service-to-service latency: Target < 50ms
- Image processing pipeline: Target < 200ms
- Memory usage per service
- CPU utilization during peak loads

ðŸš€ Next Steps:
Build the lightweight end-to-end reference system.
Set up initial Docker environments for development.
Onboard interns & assign modular tasks.
Validate cross-platform behavior & CI/CD pipelines.
Monitor system latency and evaluate need for gRPC migration.
